          <Paragraph>
            We provide certain features that let you communicate more privately
            or control who sees your content. For example, you can use Direct
            Messages to have non-public conversations on Krishaki, protect your
            Posts, or host private broadcasts on Periscope. When you communicate
            with others by sending or receiving Direct Messages, we will store
            and process your communications and information related to them.
            This includes link scanning for malicious content, detection of
            spam4, abuse and prohibited images, and use of reported issues. We
            also use information about whom you have communicated with and when
            (but not the content of those communications) to better understand
            the use of our services, to protect the safety and integrity of our
            platform, and to show more relevant content. We share the content of
            your Direct Messages with the people you’ve sent them to; we do not
            use them to serve you ads. Note that if you interact in a way that
            would ordinarily be public with Krishaki content shared with you via
            Direct Message, for instance by liking a Post, those interactions
            will be public. When you use features like Direct Messages to
            communicate, remember that recipients have their own copy5 of your
            communications on Krishaki - even if you delete your copy of those
            messages from your account - which they may duplicate, store, or
            re-share.

          <Title>2.8 Personalizing Based On Your Inferred Identity</Title>
          <Paragraph>
            When you log into Krishaki on a browser or device, we will associate
            that browser or device with your account for purposes such as
            authentication, security, and personalization. Subject to your
            settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or
            devices other than those you use to log into Krishaki (or associate
            your logged-out device or browser with other browsers or devices).
            When you provide other information to Krishaki, including an email
            address, we associate that information with your Krishaki account.
            Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order
            to infer other information about your identity, for example by
            associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share
            common components with the email address you have provided to
            Krishaki. We do this to operate and personalize our services. For
            example, if you visit websites with sports content on your laptop,
            we may show you sports-related ads on Krishaki for Android and, if
            the email address associated with your account shares components
            with another email address, such as shared first name, last name, or
            initials, we may later match advertisements to you from advertisers
            that were trying to reach email addresses containing those
            components.
